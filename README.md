## üìÇ Data Structure

This portfolio uses CSV files to manage its content dynamically. You'll find example CSV files in the `data_templates` directory. To populate your portfolio, create a `public/data` directory and place your filled CSV files there, following the structure of the examples.

**Important:** Your personal data in `public/data` will be ignored by Git to protect your privacy. Only the structure and example files are committed to the repository.
