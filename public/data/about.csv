"I am a passionate and curious technologist with a strong foundation in data science, IoT, and software development. My journey spans building predictive models, data pipelines, and interactive devices, along with hands-on experience in creating engaging dashboards and visualization tools."
"Beyond academics and internships, I run a personal homelab, where I explore self-hosted services, containerized environments, and server monitoring setups. This has sharpened my ability to design scalable systems, optimize resources, and experiment with tools that mirror real-world infrastructure."
"I also love bringing ideas to life through projects like Fiore (an event-based social platform), AvignaTattva (a holistic wellness app), and Cryptobeast Arena (a real-time multiplayer game). At the core, Iâ€™m driven by the belief that technology, when creatively applied, can solve real-world problems and open doors to meaningful innovation."
